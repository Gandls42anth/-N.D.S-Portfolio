This is Nathan Steelman's Portfolio
It contains both completed and in progress projects.

Currently it contains:
Giraffe Noise 2 (Completed)
We Need Space (WIP)
UntitledQTE (WIP)

I'm  most proud of We Need Space as that is the most recent and most polished of the 3.
Documentation for We Need Space is seperate from the other projects.
We Need Space also has its own repository from when it was being worked on by multiple people, here's the link: https://github.com/JacksonBlanchard/WeNeedSpace
